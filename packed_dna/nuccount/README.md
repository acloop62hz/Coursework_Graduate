# This Crate
This is a binary crate that implements a simple nucleotide counter based on the user input.

Provided is command-line argument parsing to retrieve the user input DNA as a `String`.

# Tasks
The main functionality must be implemented, it is described fully in the `TODO` comment.

If in implementing this task you require new functionality from the `dna` crate feel free to add it (hint you probably will need to).
